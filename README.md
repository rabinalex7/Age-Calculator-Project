It's useful for various applications like age verification, demographic analysis, and more.

# Python Libraries and Modules Used:

MODULES: A module is essentially a container for related Python code, allowing you to structure your programs in a modular way.

LIBRARIES: A Python library is a collection of modules and packages that offer pre-written code, making it easier to perform specific tasks without having to write the code from scratch.

PACKAGES: A packag is a way to organize related modules into a hierarchical directory structure, essentially acting as a namespace for those modules.

FRAMEWORKS:  a structured foundation or platform, a collection of pre-built modules and packages, that provides a standardized way to build and deploy software applications, streamlining the development process. 

# 1. tkinter
Tkinter is a Python library that lets you create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for desktop applications.

# 2. messagebox
Tkinter Messagebox is a module in python which provides a different set of dialogues that are used to display inside the message boxes like showing errors or warnings.The messagebox displays a message window, also known as a dialog box, which presents a message to the user. It is a modal window, blocking other actions in the application until the user closes it. A MessageBox can contain text, buttons, and symbols that inform and instruct the user.

# 3. calendar
Python has a built-in module called the Calendar module which allows you to perform date, month, and calendar-related operations while even letting you manipulate your code for some specific day or month of the year. The Calendar module in python uses the idealized calendar which is the current Gregorian calendar.

# 4. PIL(pillow)
PIL stands for Python Imaging Library, and it's the original library that enabled Python to deal with images. Pillow is the friendly PIL fork that kept the library alive. It adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

# 5. tkcalendar
tkcalendar is a python module that provides the Calendar and DateEntry widgets for Tkinter. The DateEntry widget is similar to a Combobox, but the drop-down is not a list but a Calendar to select a date.

# 6. datetime
datetime in Python is the combination between dates and times. The attributes of this class are similar to both date and separate classes. These attributes include day, month, year, minute, second, microsecond and hour.The datetime module additionally allows for simple date arithmetic and formatting date strings into standard formats.

# 7. dateutil
The dateutil module is a predefined module in Python that helps you manipulate and work with dates and time stamps. You can use it for a number of purposes when working with dates, such as adding dates, parsing dates in different formats, subtracting dates, calculating the difference between two dates.

# 8. math
The math module in Python is a built-in module that provides functions for mathematical operations. It can be used for basic arithmetic and advanced scientific computations.
